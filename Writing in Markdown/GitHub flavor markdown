# GitHub flavor markdown
GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) adds some extra features on top of plain Markdown. These include:
* Tables
* Task lists (checkboxes)
* Strikethrough
* Autolinks
* @ mentions for users or teams
* Emojis
* Syntax highlighting for code

It also stops certain HTML tags from working for security reasons.

I will cover the extra features in their own individual articles. 


## What HTML is not supported?
The following HTML tags are not supported:
```
<script>
<style>
<iframe>
<embed>, <object>, <applet>
<form>, <input>, <button>, <select>
<link>
<meta>
<title>, <head>, <html>, <body>
<frame>, <frameset>
<video>, <audio>
```
Inline CSS styles are supported in some rendering tools and Static Site Generators, but not all. For example, they are supported in Docusaurus but are stripped out on GitHub.com.
