# Emphasis

There are different types of emphasis supported in basic Markdown:
Italic
Bold

## Italic

For italic text, use an asterisk * before and after the terms you want to emphasize. Alternatively, you can use an underscore before and after the terms _ but this may be more likely to cause issues later down the line, especially if you need to write about files that use underscores in their filenames.

Guess which word I'm going to make appear in *italicized* text?

I don't use italics very often as they can be difficult for some dyslexic people to read. The British Dyslexia Association states:

"Avoid underlining and italics as this can make the text appear to run together and cause crowding. Use bold for emphasis. (Dyslexia Style Guide 2022)."

The GOV.UK design system also states:

"Don't use italics, as this text can be difficult for dyslexic users to read".

## Bold

Use double asterisk before and after the terms you want to emphasize. I'd commonly use this strong bold text for the names of options that users need to select.

1. Select **Open**.
2. Select **Auto-render**.
3. Select **Save** when the rendering is complete.

You can use double underscores instead of double asterisk.

## What if you want the emphasis character to appear in your text?

If you want a character that is used for emphasis to appear in your text, you will need to "escape" it. Use the backslash character ( \\ ) immediately before the character you want to keep.

For example, you might have a sentence that contains underscores as part of a file name and you want those to be visible in the text, not used as emphasis. For that, you would put a backslash before the underscores.

Enter the type with an underscore prefix and suffix, like this:

`\_type\_`

Result:

\_type\_
