# Lists
Let's look at creating bullet lists, numbered lists, and nested versions of both list types.
 
## Unordered list
Start each line with an asterisk, plus symbol, or dash. Put a space after the character you used and then enter your text.

```
* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3


```
Result:
* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3 
  
### Nested unordered list
To create a nested unordered list, create the upper level list item and then add another line. Start that line with 2 spaces or 4 spaces and then add a new list item using asterisk, plus symbol or dash.

````
* List item 1
* List item 2
  * List 2.1 Item 1
  * List 2.1 Item 2
* List item 3
* List item 4
````

Result:
* List item 1
* List item 2
  * List 2.1 Item 1
  * List 2.1 Item 2
* List item 3
* List item 4


## Ordered list (number list)
Enter the number followed by a full stop and a space.You don't need to use correct numbering in Markdown as they will render in order, but it makes more sense to use the correct numbers, right?

````
1. List item 1
2. List item 2
3. List item 3
````

### Nested ordered list
It works in the same way as nested unordered lists. Start the upper level list and then, on the line for the next list item, add 2 or 4 spaces at the start.

````
1. First item
    1. Subitem 1
    1. Subitem 2
1. Second item
````

Result:
1. First item
   1. Subitem 1
   1. Subitem 2
1. Second item

## Mixing the list styles
You can have bullet lists inside a numbered list and vice-versa. Again, just use 2 or 4 spaces to indent and then use the appropriate character for the list, such as asterisk or dash.
````
1. Step one
   * Item 1
   * Second detail
2. Step two
   * Another point
   * More info
````
Result:
1. Step one
   - First detail
   - Second detail
2. Step two
   - Another point
   - More info

## Task Lists (Checkboxes)

These are only available if you use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).

Enter square brackets for the checkboxes. To have a box checked by default, enter an X inside the square brackets.
